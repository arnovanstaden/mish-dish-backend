Slice up your onion and start to fry in your pot. [Side note, from beginning to start you should keep your pot on low heat]. 
Finely chop your garlic and ginger and add to your onions. 
Cook for about 5-10 minutes until the onions are slightly browning. 
Julienne your peppers (the thinner the slices the better as then they will ‘cook away’ and add a lot of sweetness and flavor to your dish). 
Add to your onions and stir thoroughly. 
Cut your chicken into small slices/chunks and season with salt & pepper. 
Add to your onions & peppers and stir thoroughly. 
Cook until your chicken pieces are white (no red in sight) but not until brown. 
Add your thai green curry paste and stir through thoroughly. 
 Add your coconut milk and frozen peas, stir thoroughly and allow to simmer for app 20 minutes. 
 Cook your rice while your curry is simmering. 
 In a bowl, serve rice, curry and your sambals - viola!
